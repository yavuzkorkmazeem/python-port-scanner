# Simple Python Port Scanner

This is my updated Python port scanner script. It scans specified IP addresses for open TCP ports using multithreading to speed up the process.

🚧 **Note:**  
This version improves on the first by allowing multiple IPs to be scanned, supports user-defined port ranges, and validates IP addresses before scanning.

### Features in this version:
- Scan multiple IP addresses in one run  
- Validate IP addresses before scanning  
- Specify start and end ports for scanning  
- Use multithreading for faster scanning  
- Timeout settings for quicker responses  

🎯 **Goal:**  
Keep learning Python networking and improve the tool gradually.

## Future Plans 🔮

- Save scan results to a file 📝  
- Add banner grabbing to identify services 🔍  
- Support scanning IP ranges or subnets 🌐  
- Better output formatting for clearer results 📊
